## Planning

### Setting up my board

- I decided on a css grid as tic-tac-toe is played in a grid
- To make the board look like a tic-tac-toe board, I used aspect-ratio, which made my grid components into squares
- In addition I changed the border colors of all the edges to be white
#### TO DO
- From here I intend to create a new home html page with abutton labeled 'start' that will bring the user to this html page
