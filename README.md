# Tic-Tac-Toe

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

## Planning

### Making a start page

- In order to give the user the option to start their own tic-tac-toe game I decided to make a homepage
- Used another grid as the formatting is simple enough
- Used the aspect-ratio and calc() for first time - documentation below
### Setting up my board

- I decided on a css grid as tic-tac-toe is played in a grid
- To make the board look like a tic-tac-toe board, I used aspect-ratio, which made my grid components into squares
- In addition I changed the border colors of all the edges to be white
